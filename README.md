# Page Reload Study
```page-reload``` is the add-on for a [Shield study](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Shield/Shield_Studies) that aims to understand the feasibility and effectiveness of predicting page breakage from users' page reload behavior and feedback. This could eventually help report broken websites automatically and improve the web compatibility of Firefox.

## Hypothesis
The number of page reloads for a page paired with the hostname of that page gives a significant prediction power of page breakage.
